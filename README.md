## Testing

I have conducted intensive testing and ensured the users of this website can navigate form everypage without having to use the back button.

With the use of putting contents into container, I have been able to ensure that the iages or text do not disturt in different screen sizes. 

The main bugs during my testing phrase were minor error or a missed closed declaration which by th help of the validator to locate them I was able to sort them all out. 

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator]("http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer")

### Unfixed Bugs

The bugs I have found after an intensive run-through and testing of my website are:
- The contact us details are not fixed and move when the page size is reduced.
- The google map is not interactive - night vision and zoom in and out does not operate.

## Deployment

I ran into some issues during my deployment process. I tried to debug the issues by myself which resulted in deleting the linked repo to the project I worked on in gitpod. The project coding was not lost and after having a live chat with the tutors, I was adviced to create a new repo and I will loose the logs of all the days of changes that were done to get to this point.

- I resolved the issue by the following steps:
  - I created a new repository in github.
  - Followed by a new workspace to link both together.
  - I copied and pasted the step-by-step process (while commiting my steps)
  - This resolved the issue and got my project completed.

## Credits 

I have had to source materials from the web such as background pictures, videos, and google map to complete the requirements of my project. This has been broken down into 3 steps: Content, Media and Other sources.

### Others
  - During my project process I drew on a piece of paper the layout on how I will like my project to look. I then watched a lot of videos on youtube to learn different CSS coding ideas. The vast information I got from youtube and my educational materials were what I put together to customise my own project and ensured no copy and paste data was used to prevent plagiarism.
